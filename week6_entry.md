Week: Week 6.

Learning Activities & Resources: Group setup, agreement and contacts.

Estimated Hours: We spent over 2 days on setting up teamwork tools and most time were lost from trying to understand what we actually had to do. And less than an hour on "Group Agreement and Contacts".

Content Insights: There were 2 parts on what we had to do. First is setting up Trello to keep track of our progression, GitHub to store and share our work to professor and Slack to use as alternative communication platform although we use Discord most of the time. And we encountered promblems of not understanding excatly what to do because the tasks about GitHub and Slack described in GitHub calendar are different from we actually have to do. For example, according to GitHub calendar, I will get an invitation link from GitHub Classroom to join a shared GitHub repo but there was no link after logging into both normal GitHub and Classroom. And the Slack part also claimed to already added me in the group but there are no groups at all let alone our group. Since I cannot contact our professor via online messaging, I asked a friend who understood more and he told me to do those steps I explained on our own instead of looking for invite links and such. Most of the time were wasted because of this 1st part. 2nd part is only filling up "Group Agreement and Contacts" for us 3 members of the group in Trello board.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: I was quite stressed out from the things not being in the way they should be. It was worse because I didn't attend the class during the time when the professor was explaining about the steps although as mentioned before, they should also be explained in GitHub calendar which were apparently the correct way. My classmates and group members are also having the same issues and cannot contact the professor for his guidance so for now, I will just create a Slack group of my own although I have absolutely no idea about what to do with the GitHub repo but should be fine since we can just show our progresses to him in the class next time we meet him face to face.
