Week: Week 6.

Learning Activities & Resources: Group setup, agreement and contacts.

Estimated Hours: We spent 2 days on setting up teamwork tools.

Content Insights: Professor gave us two options to do this child theme customization, the first method was to use Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV) which I thought was that it seems to be way more complicated and more time consuming so I decided to use second method where I have to override styles in style.css for customization. Since the professor only want the change of red color in title menu, that was the only thing I did.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: I was a bit distracted on spending time on this week 5 practical because of my problems regarding assignment 1 which I lost some marks and even had to redo an entire Joomla website from start again because of the error of me switching from XAMPP to Local where the supporting ports got messed up and I can't even see my old Joomla website anymore. At least I was able to retrieve one of the two websites which I made with WordPress because I did an emergency backup. I wasn't able to gave full attention during week 5 practical class either because of that and so I might made some mistakes For this practical but at least I was able to finish this in time since I still has more works to finish for other subjects.
