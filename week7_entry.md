Week: Week 7.

Learning Activities & Resources: Setting up and testing PHP on Visual Studio Code and then preparation for assignment 2 group project.

Estimated Hours: I should have finished the practical in just over an hour but because of my slow learning and not being able to kept following steps by steps instructions during practical session, I got completely left behind and had to spent over a whole day by looking for the instructions online and implementing them.

Content Insights: There were 2 parts on what I had to do. First I had to install some plug-ins in Visual Studio Code to be able to use PHP and write some basic codes in there to test whether it was working. ![Uploading Screenshot (66).pngâ€¦]()
Then have to prepare configuration of PHP implementations for the assignment group project which I wasn't able to keep up with and I will explain in detailed below.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: I was able to follow and do the steps for the fist part during the practical session. But during the second part when the professor started showing steps by steps implementations with Powerpoint slides which are extremely important for the assignment 2 group project, I got completely lost way about almost anything I have to do. I wasn't to keep up with his fast pacing on showing the slides then I wasn't able to understand and configure PHP implementations just because I was looking for a file which wasn't in the same folder as in the instructions. I tried to ask the professor who was instructing us about those slides to upload those steps by steps slides in LearnJCU so I can work on my own but he declined saying as it was "Independent Learning". I got absolutely frustrated. I had to ask every friends I know in the class to provide me with what they remember from those slides. Reminder that what I was completely clueless and don't know what to do is worth 10 points in 50 points assignment project so I think I at least have a reason to be so frustrated like this.
