Week: 
	Week 4.

Learning Activities & Resources: 
	Creation and demonstration of dynamic site on my local host using my PC.

Estimated Hours: 
	I spent less than an hour since I already did this during week 2.
 
Content Insights: 
	Although I have already done all of these for my first website creation with Joomla during second week, I had to redo all of these again. Because my previous local host became completely unuseable due to the second and third website I made in week 3 using Wordpress in Local also happened to be using the default apache port 80 which was the same port the XAMPP control panel I was using for the Joomla website previously. But thanks to my professor, I was able to use local host using XAMPP again with his advice of uninstalling previous XAMPP and reinstalling it again although I can no longer use and see the website I created in my week 2 with Joomla.
  The first image is the screenshot of my website and it's URL (http://localhost/joomla/) taken from my PC.

  The second image is the screenshot of how used phpMyAdmin for local host by activating default configuration of Apache and MySQL ports to set up the local environment.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: 
	All of this week learning were already done as self-learning in my second week so there is not much to say except I had to take a look at what I did back then again. I was really frustrated on how I cannot even look at my first website I built using XAMPP and Joomla anymore because I did not know about how using Wordpress might mess up Joomla because of ports which was also one of the requirements for first assignment and I would get low marks for them too.
