Week: Week 8.

Learning Activities & Resources: Understanding WordPress Development Work Flow and its themes construction.

Estimated Hours: It took me just around 2 hours for all these activities since they are just self-learning. I didn't include professor's lectures where he explained WordPress themes because it was only a small session of 2 hours 50 minutes lecture. 

Content Insights: For the Modern WordPress Development Workflow, we had to watch a YouTube video explaining about it which is around 15 minutes then read a blog post about Wordflow guide on [seahawkmedia.com](https://seahawkmedia.com/wordpress/wordpress-development-workflow/) as self-study. Also the WordPress themes development were explained in lecture session by the professor which is one of the most important configurations for the assignment 2 / group project. There were no more content insights since we were focusing more on the assignment.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: I actually just scanned through the learning parts since I am already familiar with WordPress for developments, roles and environment but quality and performance of the website are not going to matter much since we are building a website based on an already existing website. Reminder that my weekly practical and group project are related.
