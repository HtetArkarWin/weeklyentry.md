Content Insights: 
	Within 2 days of working on this week for this subject, I spent first day to research and learn more about Joomla plus php online since I have never heard of them before until now. Then next day with prior knowledge I gained, I started building a website of my desire for requirement of both week 2 practical and assignment 1. My Joomla website's screenshots were taken as below.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: 
	I first had to googled what or how Joomla is used for. I read some articles about the platform and watch videos of it. Then had to find easy to understand tutorial video on YouTube on how to build a website using Joomla. I was kind of nervous at first before working on all of these but became relaxed after starting to work on the website.
