Week: 
	Week 3.

Learning Activities & Resources: 
	Self-learning WordPress on it's usage and practical building of two websites using its services.

Estimated Hours: 
	I spent around 7 hours on self-learning Wordpress, building two websites using it and finding a migration method to provide my local website to professor. Group interviews were not counted here.
 
Content Insights: 
	I spent almost a week not because of me having a hard time understanding Wordpress usage but spending extra time on figuring out how do I have to migrate my local website to live server so the professor can view it. The first website I built will be used for the assignement and the second website will be used for third week practical assessment. Group interviews were done later in the week since I just finished working on Wordpress later than expected. The screenshots for the second Wordpress website, the practical one, are as captured below.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights: 
	Learning Wordpress usage is the same as Joomla from last week with just one or two tutorial videos but I had to search on many forums and watch videos explaining the migration methods from local to live. What made it worse is that not only there are many more alternative methods I found which I am unsure of, but also all the methods I found required real money to purchase the service plan to host my website live. Since I have no experience of buying service plans like this let alone website hosting, I decided to use "All-in-One WP Migration" plug-in which will require the professor to import my submitted wpress website file on his empty wordpress website to view it. I avoided using plugins that replace the core CMS functionality like nicepage, Elementor or similar ones as described so I hope I will be safe.
